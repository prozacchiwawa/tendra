#
# We need to identify which compiler is being used, for two reasons: firstly,
# to set a few sensible global default options here, and secondly to permit
# compiler-specific options per directory within the source (typically to
# specify APIs and increase strictness).
#
#
# The following compilers may be specified by setting their corresponding
# environment variables when calling make(1):
#
#  ${TCC}    - TenDRA
#  ${GCC}    - The GNU Compiler Collection
#  ${PCC}    - The Portable C Compiler
#  ${CLANG}  - The Clang C compiler
#  ${HPCC}   - HP's ANSI C Compiler
#  ${TINYCC} - The Tiny C Compiler
#
# If none of the above are set, no compiler-specific default options are used
# (either globally, or per directory).
#
#
# Each of these (where '*' is one of the above) may have language-specific
# global default options:
#
#  ${*CPPOPTS} - Options for preprocessing
#  ${*CCOPTS}  - Options for C
#  ${*CXXOPTS} - Options for C++
#
# The global defaults for these may be overridden by explicitly specifying them
# to make(1), which will replace any existing values.
#
# ${CCOPTS} is unrelated to the above; it serves to specify options which are
# language-independant, applicable to all compilers (such as -I, for example).
#
#
# If present, any compiler-specific options (either global, or per-directory)
# are appended to CFLAGS et al., along with whatever content those may have
# already.
#
# The net effect is that ${CC} and ${C*FLAGS} may be explicitly specified to
# make(1) as per usual, and doing so will not remove any compiler-specific
# options, if present.
#


# TODO: attempt to guess based on ${CC} for common compilers.
# Note that "tcc" is not included here to prevent ambiguity with tinycc.
# TODO: think more about this. we need ${CLANG} to take precidence over ${CC}
# TODO: can this use sh's 'case x in y' construct?
