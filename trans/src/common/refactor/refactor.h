/*
 * The routine refactor performs the bottom-up TDF-to-TDF optimising
 * transformations. When a new exp is created refactor is applied to
 * see if a recognised situation has arisen. refactor assumes that
 * all components of this new exp have already had refactor applied to them.
 * It returns 1 if it has made a change, 0 if not.
 *
 * hold_refactor holds an exp as the child of a dummy exp and then
 * applies refactor. the need for this operation is explained in
 * the overall documentation.
 *
 * eq_exp compares two exp for equality of effect.
 *
 * dochvar takes the int, i, and delivers the number which results from
 * changing its variety to that specified by the shape, t.
